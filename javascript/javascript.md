## Commentary

I really love JavaScript, especially functionally. This is normally the way i try tyo use JS. Whenever I write a program in JS, I tend to use map functions over for loops if I can. I find this helps me to think about moving data around in a better way. It is especially helpful when working with Promises, because I can use a map function to get asynchronous data from various sources, in parallel, essentially just firing off a ton of requests, the using the Promise.all function which takes an array of promises(the map function) I can wait for all the data to come back. I also took the time to get to know all of the fancy shorthands like the spread operator, and arrow functions, which after hearing you compare lambda functions to "anonymous" functions, helped me to feel more at home.
